ShopSync Manager is a JavaFX-based desktop application designed to streamline small tech shop operations. Manage product sales, repairs, mobile recharges, and inventory—all in one place. Powered by a SQLite backend, it offers real-time reporting, category-based product tracking (Phones, Headphones, etc.), and a user-friendly interface for shop owners on the go.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two default folders:

    src: Contains all source files (Java and FXML).
    lib: Holds dependencies (JavaFX SDK and SQLite JDBC).

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are managed manually via referenced libraries:

    Referenced Libraries:
        lib/**/*.jar (all JARs in lib/ and subdirectories)
        lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar (SQLite JDBC driver)
        lib/javafx-sdk (JavaFX SDK folder)
